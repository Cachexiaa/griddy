# Place your icons anywhere on the grid with Griddy

Gone are the days of your apps being placed one after another. 
With Griddy, you can drag them anywhere, leaving blank spaces or even entire rows!

Show off your background, or create fancy designs; no matter how you want to arrange your icons, Griddy will let you.

**Key features:**

- Custom layouts on home screen, dock and in folders
- Intuitive drag-and-drop controls
- Support for any sized icon or widget
- Separate layouts for portrait and landscape orientations
- Saving layout between resprings and reboots

No matter if you're a minimalist or enjoy a creative scatter, arrange your icons however you want with Griddy!

Griddy supports any device on iOS 15 or 16

I'd just like to thank [donato-fiore](https://github.com/donato-fiore) for all the help with Griddy. The project would not be where it is today without him.
